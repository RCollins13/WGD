### Example WGD workflow  
#### Important Note Regarding Bedtools Compatibility  
As of ```bedtools 2.24.0```, some arguments and parameters changed for ```bedtools coverage```, an essential element of the WGD workflow. The WGD pipeline has been tested with ```bedtools 2.20.1``` and ```bedtools 2.25.1```, thus includes compatibility for both "new" and "old" parameter specifications, but one step (```binCov.py```) will require an argument to specify which version of ```bedtools``` you are using. See more details in the [usage note for ```binCov.py```](https://github.com/RCollins13/WGD#bincovpy) 
#### Prerequisites  
The WGD pipeline requires the following:  
- Coordinate-sorted, indexed bams for all samples
- List of contigs to evaluate
- Bed-file of N-masked regions of the reference genome. These are available for most reference genome assemblies from [UCSC](http://genome.ucsc.edu/ "UCSC Genome Browser")  

#### Step 1: Generate normalized coverage per chromosome on all libraries  
Normalized coverage is calculated by ```binCov.py``` on a per-chromosome basis. For whole-genome dosage bias analyses, nucleotide coverage at bin sizes of at least 10kb is recommended. Only primary autosomal contigs recommended; e.g. 1...22 for humans. Parallelization of this process is encouraged.  

There are two approaches to parallelization, depending on your available computational resources. Examples are given below using LSF as a scheduler, but could be easily configured to your scheduler/environment.  

**Fully parallelized approach** (almost always preferable)
```
#!/usr/env/bin bash  
while read sample; do
  while read contig; do
    bsub "binCov.py ${sample}.bam ${contig} ${sample}.${contig}.rawCov.bed \
    -n ${sample}.${contig}.normCov.bed \
    -b 10000 \
    -m nucleotide \
    -x /path/to/Nmask.bed"
  done < list_of_contigs.txt
done < list_of_samples.txt
```  

Alternatively, if available cores are limited or sample sizes are large, a wrapper script, ```WG_binCov.sh```, will calculate normalized coverage for a set of contigs in serial from a single bam.  

**Semi-parallelized approach** (preferred if available cores are dramatically fewer than [#contigs x #samples])
```
#!/usr/env/bin bash  
while read sample; do
  bsub "WG_binCov.sh ${sample}.bam ${sample} `pwd` \
  -L list_of_contigs.txt \
  -b 10000 \
  -m nucleotide \
  -x /path/to/Nmask.bed"
done < list_of_samples.txt
```

#### Step 2: Create normalized dosage matrix for cohort  
Once ```binCov.py``` has completed on all desired contigs for each sample, concatenate the normalized coverage beds per sample into a single bed file. Sorting or ordering of the concatenated bed file is not necessary.  

Creating the coverage matrix can be done with ```bedtools unionbedg```, but for sake of convenience has been automated by ```makeMatrix.sh```, as follows:  
```
makeMatrix.sh input.txt > normCov.matrix.bed
```  

An example of the input file (```input.txt``` above):  
```
sample1    /path/to/sample1.cov.bed
sample2    /path/to/sample2.cov.bed
sample3    /path/to/sample3.cov.bed
...
sampleN    /path/to/sampleN.cov.bed
```  

#### Step 3: Run WGD model  
TBD  

#### Optional: Visualization of dosage biases  
TBD  

#### Optional: Calcuating per-sample and binwise coverage distribution properties
Median values can be evaluated with ```medianCoverage.R```. This tool operates in two modes (1) medians per bin across all samples, and (2) medians per sample across all bins. For each, median coverages are returned when considering all data and also when excluding bins (or samples) with zero coverage. See [documentation of medianCoverage.R](https://github.com/RCollins13/WGD#mediancoverager)  for details of this process.

### Pipeline runtimes  
**binCov.py**  

The rate-limiting step of the pipeline is ```binCov.py```, which scales linearly with the number of reads per library. A successful run of all 22 human autosomes for a conventional 30X Illumina 2x100bp or 2x150bp WGS library usually takes approximately 3-6 hours (single-core CPU, 2GB RAM, 5GB swap, 1kb bins). This is the reason for maximizing parallelization where possible (see [earlier example](https://github.com/RCollins13/WGD#step-1-generate-normalized-coverage-per-chromosome-on-all-libraries)).  

Physical coverage is marginally faster than nucleotide coverage. Bin sizes â‰¥100bp do not strongly influence runtime.

### CNV visualization and annotation  
#### Companion visualization tool: CNView  
[CNView](https://github.com/RCollins13/CNView) is a companion tool for WGD that can visualize, score, and annotate CNVs directly from ___raw___ ```makeMatrix.sh``` output. More details on CNView can be found [here](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/20/049536). If you use CNView, please cite [Collins et al., 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/20/049536).

### binCov.py
Iterates through a single chromosome of a bam file and calculates either nucleotide or physical coverage in regularly segmented bins.
```
usage: binCov.py [-h] [-n NORM_OUT] [-b BINSIZE] [-m {nucleotide,physical}]
                 [-x BLACKLIST] [-p] [-v OVERLAP] [--oldBT]
                 bam chr cov_out

Calculates non-duplicate primary-aligned binned coverage of a chromosome from
an input BAM file

positional arguments:
  bam                   Input bam
  chr                   Contig to evaluate
  cov_out               Output bed file of raw coverage

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n NORM_OUT, --norm_out NORM_OUT
                        Output bed file of normalized coverage
  -b BINSIZE, --binsize BINSIZE
                        Bin size in bp (default: 1000)
  -m {nucleotide,physical}, --mode {nucleotide,physical}
                        Evaluate nucleotide or physical coverage (default:
                        nucleotide)
  -x BLACKLIST, --blacklist BLACKLIST
                        BED file of regions to ignore
  -z                    Boolean flag to gzip output bed files
  -p, --presubsetted    Boolean flag to indicate if input bam is already
                        subsetted to desired chr
  -v OVERLAP, --overlap OVERLAP
                        Maximum tolerated blacklist overlap before excluding
                        bin
  --oldBT               Boolean flag to indicate if you are using a bedtools
                        version pre-2.24.0
```  
**Usage Notes:**  
- Input bam file must be coordinate-sorted and indexed.  
- Only non-duplicate primary-aligned reads or proper pairs are considered for 'nucleotide' and 'physical' mode, respectively.  
- Normalized coverage is raw coverage per bin divided by median of all non-zero, non-blacklisted bins on the same contig.  
- Bins will be ignored automatically if they share at least ```-v``` percent overlap by size with blacklisted regions (```-x``` or ```--blacklist```).  
- Currently uses ```bedtools coverage``` syntax assuming ```bedtools``` version 2.24.0 or later (i.e. ```-a``` is bins and ```-b``` is reads; this was reversed starting in ```bedtools v2.24.0```). Specify option ```--oldBT``` to revert to bedtools syntax pre-2.24.0.

### makeMatrix.sh
Helper tool to automate creation of sorted coverage matrices from binCov.py output bed files. Wraps ```bedtools unionbedg```. Note that, in most cases, multiple chromosome outputs from binCov.py from the same sample should be concatenated before being passed to this tool.  
```
usage: makeMatrix.sh [-h] [-z] [-o OUTFILE] SAMPLES

Helper tool to automate creation of sorted coverage matrices from
binCov.py output bed files

Positional arguments:
  SAMPLES     List of samples and coverage files (tab-delimmed)

Optional arguments:
  -h  HELP      Show this help message and exit
  -z  GZIP      Gzip output file
  -o  OUTFILE   Output file (default: stdout)
```
**Usage Notes:**  
- Does not sanity check to ensure that sample IDs are identical between matrices, or that samples were included in the same order when passed to makeMatrix.sh.

---  

### medianCoverage.R
Helper tool to calculate median coverages per-bin across all samples or per-sample across all bins. Medians are reported both with and without considering zero-coverage bins or samples. Uses a sorted coverage matrix as can be generated by makeMatrix.sh (see above).
```
usage: medianCoverage.R [-h] [-b/--binwise] covMatrix.bed OUTFILE

Helper tool to calcualte âˆšarious medians from binCov matrices

Positional arguments:
  covMatrix.bed   path to binCov coverage matrix
  OUTFILE         full path to desired output file

Optional arguments:
  -h  HELP      Show this help message and exit
  -b/--binwise  Compute medians of all samples per bin [default: median of all bins per sample]
```  
**Usage Notes:**  
- NOTE: Automatically downsamples to 1M bins (in per-sample mode) or 500 samples (in per-bin mode) to increase computational efficiency. Will add an option at a later date to disable downsampling.
- DEV NOTE: will be extended to calcuate other measurements, such as standard deviation, mean, median absolute deviation, quartiles, and min/max

---  

### compressCov.sh
Helper tool to compress bincov output (individual sample files or mutli-sample matrices) into larger bin sizes. By default, median values per new bin are reported.
```
usage: compressCov.sh [-h] [-z] [-n] [-o OUTFILE] INPUT RATIO

Helper tool to automate compression of raw binCov.py output bed files or
bed-style coverage matrices into larger bin sizes

Positional arguments:
  INPUT     path to binCov.py bed file or bed-stype matrix
  RATIO     compression ratio

Optional arguments:
  -h  HELP        Show this help message and exit
  -z  GZIP        Gzip output file
  -s  SUM         Report sum (default: report median)
  -o  OUTFILE     Output file (default: stdout)
```  
**Usage Notes:**  
- Compression ratio (RATIO) must be a positive integer. New bins will be automatically instantiated with a size equal to RATIO times the current binsize. New bins that do not overlap any previous bins (e.g. bins were excluded due to blacklisting (-x) during binCov.py) will not be reported.
- Input file does not have to be split by chromosome.
