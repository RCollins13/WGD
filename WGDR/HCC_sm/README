HCC_sm is a smaller version of the HCC directory, reporting the chromosome and 
reads for only the first 20 Mb of chromosome 1. Using files from this directory 
should allow the example file to run on personal computers with approximately 6G memory.

We publish reads from chromosome 1 of the HCC1569 breast cancer cell line. 
After unzipping, the data consists of 2 read files (HCC1569_chr1_sm_fwd.cln, HCC1569_chr1_sm_rev.cln)
and 2 fasta files - the chromosome and the repeats (45 bp reads) file - describing the first 20 Mb of 
human chromosome 1. 
A few notes: 1. The fragment lengths are wrong, and need to be extended by 45 bps. 
             2. The chromosome files are based on the NCBI build 36 (h_sapiens_asm)
	     3. As this is a cancer cell, it has large CN deviations. 
                Try estimating the GC curves on regions with relatively little 
                CN changes to see if this matters. Data from 10-50 M should be enough for
